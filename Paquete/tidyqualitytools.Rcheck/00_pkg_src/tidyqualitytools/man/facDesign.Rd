\usage{
facDesign(
  k = 3,
  p = 0,
  replicates = 1,
  blocks = 1,
  centerCube = 0,
  random.seed = 1234
)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{numeric value giving the number of factors. By default k is set to ‘3’.}

\item{p}{numeric integer between ‘0’ and ‘7’. p is giving the number of additional factors in the response surface design by aliasing effects.
For further information see fracDesign and fracChoose.
By default p is set to ‘0’.}

\item{replicates}{numeric value giving the number of replicates per factor combination. By default replicates is set to ‘1’.}

\item{blocks}{numeric value giving the number of blocks. By default blocks is set to ‘1’. Blocking is only performed for k greater 2.}

\item{centerCube}{numeric value giving the number of centerpoints within the 2^k design. By default centerCube is set to ‘0’.}
}
\value{
The function facDesign returns an object of class facDesign.
}
\description{
Generates a 2^k full factorial design.
